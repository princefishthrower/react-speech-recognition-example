# React Speech Recognition!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses the final code snippet from [this blog post](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/async/quick-look-at-react-speech-recognition/). 

Small modifications were made and changes to make the code TypeScript compatible were also completed.

Give it a try!

`git clone https://github.com/princefishthrower/react-speech-recognition-example.git`
`npm install`
`npm run start`

-> navigate to `localhost:3000`
